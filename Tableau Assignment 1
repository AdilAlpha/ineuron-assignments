### 2. What are the different Tableau products available?

##### Tableau Desktop

Tableau Desktop allows for authoring of content for visual analytics and data exploration. Perform visual analytics with multiple data sources, using drag and drop actions. Tableau Desktop enables you to explore the data and come up with new, visual, ways to answer important business questions. Furthermore, Desktop provides the capability to create interactive dashboards for guided analytics and stories. It can also publish to a server or online environment so the rest of the organization can leverage your work. This application requires Windows or a Mac computer. 

##### Tableau Prep

Tableau Prep refers to two products: Prep Builder, to help you build data flows, and Prep Conductor, to schedule, monitor, and manage flows across the organization. Prep’s main purpose is as an ETL (extract, transform, load) tool to get data ready for analysis. It allows you to visually combine data from multiple data sources. Moreover, you can clean data, and publish data sources to serve as a single source of truth for your organization. Prep Builder is locally installed, while Prep Conductor is browser based.

##### Tableau Server and Online

Share and collaborate with your organization with Tableau Server and Tableau Online by hosting workbooks, data sources, prep flows, and data extracts published through Tableau Prep or Desktop. Live connections can bring real-time data to Dashboards and workbooks. Otherwise, data extracts can be scheduled to refresh as often as every 15 mins. Furthermore, these products include productivity and efficiency improvements by allowing you to subscribe to a workbook or dashboard. Meaning Tableau can send automated and scheduled emails with your data and a link to your dashboard. Furthermore, Tableau Server/Online can send data alerts when conditions are met – like, when revenue reaches new record highs.

##### Tableau Reader

Tableau Reader is a free tool that opens packaged workbooks which allows you to view the analysis and the underlying data. Exported packaged workbooks contain static data. Unlike the other products, Tableau Reader cannot automate data refreshes. Furthermore, there are no security features on packaged workbooks – such as, password protection.

##### Tableau Public

Tableau Public allows you to share data with the world. However, it must be published through Tableau Desktop. However, instead of exporting a workbook and sending it, you publish it to Tableau Public, Tableau’s free cloud service. Like Tableau Reader, the published data is static and there are no automated data refreshes – unless you are using Google Sheets as a live data connection. Furthermore, it has limited security as it is possible to prevent people from downloading and viewing the underlaying data; however, the published workbook or dashboard is available to everyone that has access to the URL. Tableau Public is browser-based instead of local install and it can be opened on any device including mobile. Typically, the use cases for Public include sharing content with the world, for example, media or government entities that want to show COVID-19 information.

##### Tableau Mobile

Tableau Mobile is a free mobile app for accessing Tableau Server and Tableau Online on your mobile devices. While it is free, Mobile requires a Tableau license in order to use it. Tableau Mobile will automatically cache your favourite views and dashboards for offline viewing.

##### Tableau Viewer

Viewer licenses lets users view and interact with the workbooks created by others in Tableau Server, Tableau Online and Tableau Mobile. This role is assigned to users that want to put data at the centre of their conversations because it allows them to interact with dashboards and visualizations to help make informed decisions. Additional functionalities include giving access to users to add comments to workbooks, export visualizations into various formats, download workbook summary data, create subscriptions, and receive data-driven alerts.

##### Tableau Explorer

Explorers are comfortable with data and are often interested beyond the confines of pre-built reports dashboards. These users are likely receiving reports from others and combining them to obtain the answers required for deeper analysis. Explorers have all the functionalities of Tableau Viewer, but also includes the access to workbook creation and authoring capabilities using a web browser or mobile device, as well as a full set of collaboration features.

##### Tableau Creator

Tableau Creator includes two products – Tableau Desktop and Tableau Prep Builder – and are for power users in your organization. In other words, they connect to data sources, clean and prepare data, and then conduct complex analysis to create useful reports and dashboards to distribute to others either through emailed workbooks or through Tableau Server or Online. In addition to giving you all the functionalities available under the Explorer license, it also allows users to create and publish new workbooks and dashboards from a new data source, edit embedded data sources in the data pane, and create and publish new data connections.
